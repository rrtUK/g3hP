title: 08 namespace issue resolution further
---

##  Current Status  ##

###  Resolve Namespace Issue  ###

per y'days' exercise -- agreed this is a CE resource, either 63p_vUL or 25w_bscT

NOT the 'memStimGress' when ingressing the material, these are learning inits
- 11c_cRs
- 62h(e)_XekP
- 62h(d)_dAcd
for the baseline abstraction level, these line up against pers 9.3.2_coursework.  repos are more akin to 9.3.3.0.4_BoK

several 'platform' inits (one layer above 'baseline' inits) were/are candidates
- 13s_wZa xEFS
- 12g_sldg



### Surfacing Location(s) ###

L via gHp, namespace will be ProjectPresidio653PRE<at>gmail<dot>com

top level will just be a table of existing vUL resources, to swap in a proper L when heading for CD phase

three of these L (which are surfaced on the 63p_vUL L) will be linked from this homepage
- g3hP
- gt,gH
- vConf_resource
