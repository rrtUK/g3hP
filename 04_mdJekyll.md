multi-page site from markdown via jekyll<br/>

note the key difference b/w 04_mdJekyll and 05_devLog sites pertain to the jumbo and the posts
- 04_mdJekyll multi-page site pops a jumbo wi readme.md content, posts are version control
- 05_devLog blog leaves the readme.md content empty, causing the posts to situate higher up
